Here, we calculate the power spectrum (pk), two-point correlation function (2pcf), bispectrum (bk), three-point correlation function (3pcf), and their BAO reconstructed versions from the dark matter data generated by [Gadget2](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) and the dark halo data generated by [rockstar](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rockstar/).

The calculations here assume that the periodic boundary conditions and the global plane-parallel approximation hold. In this case, we do not need to take into account the effect of the observation window function and can fix the line-of-sight to the z-axis, which simplifies the algorithm for measuring cosmological statistics (pk, 2pcf, bk, and 3pcf).

If users want to handle simulation data that considers the survey geometry effect, as in the Patchy mock catalogue, please use the code in `$WORK/measurement/boss`.

Copy the three files `Makefile`, `main_box.cpp`, and `default_param.ini` in `$WORK/cosmo/hitomi_measurement`, and paste them into the user's preferred location. Users can edit these files to suit their convenience.
