# Note, if you are using a modified version of class, be sure that the

# If you want to use Planck likelihood, you should specify the
# following line:
# ** path['clik'] = /path/to/plc/
# which correspond to the folder with the src/ folder, setup.py, etc.

# If you want to use a data folder different from the one present in the folder
# you are executing the code, please also add:
# ** path['data']  =  /path/to/the/other/data/
