%% To use MPI, add "CFLAGS + -D__MPI__" in the Makefile. 
%% The "NR" parameter then controls the realization of the mock catalog to be loaded. 
%% For example, if the MPI size (NTask) is 20, and NR is 0, the mock catalogs "data_mpi_file_0001" - "data_mpi_file_0020" will be loaded;
%% if NTask is 20, and NR is 1, the samples "data_mpi_file_0021" - "data_mpi_file_0040" will be loaded.
